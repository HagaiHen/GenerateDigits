During each epoch, the function iterates over batches of real samples and labels from the training data. Then, generate a sapce sample for the Generator. this data pass through the Generator, and give them also lables.
we are combine the real and fake data.

now we pass the fake and real data to the descriminator and compare to the labels using the loss function. The gradients are backpropagated through the discriminator, and its parameters are updated using the optimizer.

After training the discriminator, the function focuses on training the generator.
we generate new sample space, and pass it to the Genartor to get samples. we pass it to the descriminator and calculate the loss of the generator. The gradients are backpropagated through the discriminator, and its parameters are updated using the optimizer. 

The function then generates random latent space samples and passes them through the generator model to generate fake samples. Labels are created for the generated samples, distinguishing them from real samples.

Next, the function trains the discriminator by passing both real and generated samples through it. The discriminator's gradients are reset, and its predictions are compared with the corresponding labels to compute the discriminator loss. The gradients are backpropagated through the discriminator, and its parameters are updated using the optimizer.

After training the discriminator, the function focuses on training the generator. It generates new random latent space samples and passes them through the generator. The generated samples are then fed into the discriminator, and its predictions are compared with the real labels. The generator loss is calculated based on the discriminator's predictions.

The gradients of the generator are reset, and backpropagation is performed to update the generator's parameters using the optimizer.

The function prints the discriminator and generator losses for the current batch and proceeds to the next batch until all batches in the epoch are processed.

Overall, the trainer function drives the training process of the GAN, progressively improving the discriminator's ability to distinguish real and generated samples, while the generator learns to produce more realistic samples to fool the discriminator.
